<h1>Database</h1><br><h3>Functional Specifications</h3>
<div style="width:800px"><p>The subject will be the books in a library. It will be used to hold basic information about the books (title, author, publisher, year published, edition, number of pages, condition, genre, Dewey Decimal) as well as information to track the books (number of copies in stock, checked out, date checked out, date due, to whom it's checked out, ebook versions, audio versions). It will be used by librarians, who will have the control to alter the data, and by the general public, who cannot alter the data but who can search the database to see the availability and status of different books. The system will only allow for data entry by librarians. The only output needed will be printed reports. The system will only require static updates. The individual file sizes will be small, but the amount of files in a library database would probably require a server-side application. Data entry screens are needed for new books and to alter the checked in/checked out information, as well as to add new users and edit existing users. Each of these will only need one data screen. The only security requirements will be user authentication for librarians who are entering or editing the information.</p>
<h3>Technical Specifications</h3>
<p>This database will run on the web using PHP and MySQL. This will be deployed using the web and a desktop. The system will need one backup server. There will need to be one main table for books that will include the bulk of the information, a separate table for audio book version information, a separate table for ebook version information, a table for the status of individual copies, a table for information on individual copies of books that are checked out (one table for each version -- print, audio, ebooks since their different form means different data needs to be stored), a table for contributors (authors/editors/translators/compilers) and a table for the information of the users. <a href="databasetech.pdf">PDF</a> </p></div>
